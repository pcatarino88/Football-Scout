# Football-Scout
This project gathers detailed stats from football players in several european leagues using [FBREF](https://fbref.com/en/) as the source.
The notebook scraps data, joins information by player and performs basic data cleaning. In the end, it consolidates information of the players of all leagues into a single dataframe and exports that information into an excel file.
